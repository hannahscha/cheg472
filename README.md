For convience the shortened descriptions are outlined below:

Assignment 2: Intro to Python workshop & learning basic functions.

Homework 4: Development of 4 applications covering a variety of chemical engineering topics.

Machine Learning 10.4: Workshop to develop an app to predict coffee orders based on preferences.

Forest Fire Prediction: Development of an application to predict if a forest fire will occur and its cost to the community based on environmental conditions.

Lab Worksheet Week 1: Basic introduction to Python functions.

Lab Worksheet Week 2 Day 1: Preprocessing of biomass gasification data.

Lab Worksheet Week 2 Day 2: Biomass gasification data analysis.

Week 3 Worksheet on SAF: Data analysis of a SAF dataset to determine correlations between variables.

Worksheet 4 Machine Learning: Developing a machine learning model on the SAF dataset.

Worksheet 5 Machine Learning: Developing a maching learning model for hydrogen storage. ** this assignment is currently being reworked on as suggested by the TA **
